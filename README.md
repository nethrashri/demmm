The percentages I referred to in the analysis describe the usage percentage of different service groups across different hours of the day. These percentages represent how much of the available time or capacity for a given service was actually utilized during each hour, normalized as a percentage. This metric is useful for understanding the intensity and timing of usage across different services.

Here's a breakdown of what these percentages mean:

Higher Percentages (represented by red on the heatmap): These indicate hours when a service group was heavily utilized. For example, if a service group like Social Media peaks at 99% usage at 4 PM, it means that during this hour, Social Media services were operating at near maximum capacity or engagement relative to their typical usage patterns.

Lower Percentages (represented by blue on the heatmap): These suggest hours with relatively lower usage. For example, a 25% usage at 3 AM for Gaming might indicate that few users were active at that time, suggesting low engagement during these hours.

These usage percentages help identify peak usage times, off-peak times, and can inform decisions related to resource allocation, marketing strategies, customer engagement, and service maintenance schedules. By analyzing when usage peaks for different service groups, businesses can optimize their operations and improve user experience by ensuring adequate resource availability during high-demand periods.
